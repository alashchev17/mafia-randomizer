# üß™ Testing

The project now includes a comprehensive testing suite:

## Unit Tests (Vitest)

Unit tests cover individual components and utilities to ensure they function correctly in isolation:

- Core components like `PlayerCard`, `GameDesk`, etc.
- Utility functions like `rolesRandomizer`
- Context providers like `SessionContext`

Run unit tests with:

```bash
npm run test        # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui     # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage # Generate test coverage report
```

## End-to-End Tests (Cypress)

E2E tests simulate real user interactions to verify the application works correctly as a whole:

- Navigation between pages
- Game setup and configuration
- Game state management

Run E2E tests with:

```bash
npm run test:e2e    # Run all E2E tests headlessly
npm run cypress:open # Open Cypress UI for interactive testing
```
